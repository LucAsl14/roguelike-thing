# NOTE: explosion is done inside the WaterProjectile class as it is something
# the projectile does of its own accord, not something the spell does. This is
# NOT the case for charging, as a waterball can very well be summoned without
# having been charged first. The spell MAY control the explosion if it is part
# of the functionality of the spell (i.e. the spellcaster MAKES the ball
# explode), and/or if there are situations where ball may not explode if it did
# not come from a spell.

# This is just a decision made somewhat arbitrarily, if you think the charging
# behavior of the water projectile would never be decoupled from the projectile
# itself, then it would make sense to move the charging behavior entirely to
# within the WaterProjectile class.
